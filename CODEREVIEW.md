# Code Review Guidelines

### Purpose of Code Review
* Understand how the code works
* Learn new methods of doing things
* Quality control

### Before You Submit Code
* Review your own code
* Get a successful build in CircleCI
* Put the name of the ticket in the subject of your pull request

### Reviewing Code
* Tone of review: Focus on the code not the developer. Reinforce positives. Give actionable suggestions.
* Run the code. Make sure it does what it's supposed to.
* Verify code against the ticket. Make sure all the requested features have been covered.
* Ask questions.
